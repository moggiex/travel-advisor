## What I liked & disliked

- Before even starting, I already like the look of the site and its ablity to pull in from multiple API's and make a visually pleasing site. Just hopin the code/app itself is on par!
- Turns out the API being used is depreciated, but thankfully still working!
- Had to put card details into Google for billing (limited to Â£1 in a budget)

## How could I expand upon this project?

- Already thinking before I start why not just go straight to Tripadvisor and get direct access to this API instead? Simple instructions here https://elfsight.com/blog/2020/10/how-to-get-tripadvisor-api-key/
